   <h1> Through The Looking Glass </h1> 
<p1> I began my dance journey at six years old. I took one class every week and prepared for my big recital at the end of the season. During the performance, most kids are known to run off the stage, start crying, or shout for their mommies in the audience, but not me. I stood on the stage with the biggest smile on my face and danced the most full out of anyone else on that stage. That's when I knew I never wanted to stop dancing.  </p1>
